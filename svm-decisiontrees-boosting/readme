2. execute the following files in the same order 
	1) svm-gpu-runtime-classification.ipynb
	2) decision-tree-gpu-runtime-classification.ipynb
	3) boosting-gpu-runtime-classification.ipynb

Note: The second file requires graphviz which can be installed by
$ pip install graphviz
If there is still an error set the environment variable to the path where graphviz is located. or
run os.environ["PATH"] += os.pathsep + 'C:\\Users\\User\\.conda\\pkgs\\graphviz-2.38-hfd603c8_2\\Library\\bin\\graphviz'
which is commented in the notebook
